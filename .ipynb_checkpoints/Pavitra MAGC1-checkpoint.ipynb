    "\n",
    "Construct a deterministic mathematical model that describes how the concentrations of the four major greenhouse gases, namely, carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and water vapour (H2O) change over time in Earth’s atmosphere.\n",
    "The model must account for natural (volcanoes, wetlands, oceans, plants) processes that add or remove these gases, forming a dynamic balance that governs atmospheric greenhouse gas levels."
